We are counting the votes for a polling station by counting te ballots and calculating the total amount of votes for each candidate. By importing the CSV file we can use all the data given to us to then open csvfile and start a CSV reader to then begin declaring variables. We can then seperate the variables by uuusing the appendix. This lets the code then read for a specific string of letters and tally that up. Finally the information then can be presented by percentages, total amount of votes and the most important, the Winner of the election as well.

For this particcular financial analysis, we must ccreate lists for months, profits, and cchanges in revenue in order to present an acccurate report. We start by reading the CSV file in the folder. From there, we list variables on just the information thats being asked. We can then read the CSV data with row in reader. This lets us grab from the appendix in multiple ways. The way months was read was through using the LEN function. By ccouuunting the amount those three letter months, we can count how many times it pops up in the set of data within a specific row. It is also presented by grabbing the difference in sum and len to gain the averag. The Bank now has it gathered that the average change within 86 months is a negative nuber. we can pull which months are the highest and lowest moments for the bank.
